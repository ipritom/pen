# Selling Language

a thought experiment and soliloquy

---
One thing, sometimes I just believe with an inner righteous feeling that nothing exists to us outside language. 

If you feel that I'm just having a big mouth or being a maniac, I apologise for this. Even so, I invite you to read to the end.

Language is everything you know. You see the world through the language you have in your brain. All facts and non-facts lie in the space of language

If you want to make sense of anything logically, you need the proper language for it. If you can't, then the experience will be spooky, illogical, and might be non-existent. You already have the language to describe a feeling in a different way, but not the proper language required to express your experience with nuance. 

In that phase, individualism comes in. Something can exist for you, but might not exist for others. There can be thousands of examples or arguments for this idea. Maybe thousands of arguments against the idea. But I want to depict something which will be logical for most of my readers.  

For understanding, imagine you have been teleported back in time 3000 years ago. In the street of Gandhaar (present-day Northeast Afghanistan), you just met a random man. You told him that a letter can be sent from Gandhaar to Harikela (present-day Sylhet) within 100 milliseconds. The person will watch your face suspiciously. Because he has no idea of the modern-day communication system that you have. You know the language of the modern communication system, and you understand within your language what is possible. 

Inside the language part of your brain, it has the understanding of physics, and you know light can be utilised to pass information to a distant part of the world, as we do today with optical fibre to connect our home to the world of the internet. You know this within your language boundary. What you don't know, you have no language for this. 

As people in the time of Galileo had no access to the language to understand that the Earth is not at the center. Even if you can experience it, you need the language to understand it. Otherwise, it will not make sense and will remain supernatural. For example, in ancient times, someone might have experienced epilepsy due to a tiny tumour in the brain. However, the people around the person would have interpreted the episode as a supernatural phenomenon, caused by a jinn or an unquenched demon. Because they did not have the current language of neuroscience.

In ancient times, many astrophysical concepts were considered supernatural simply because people did not have access to the necessary language. As a result, their minds could not explain or understand those so-called supernatural events as we can explain today. 

In today's world, a 100-millisecond delay to pass a message from Dhaka to Washington is not a supernatural belief. Because we already have the sensible language for that. 

And now, when you have something, you can capitalise on that. Like, you can sell patriotism because patriotism exists vividly in the space of language. People can also sell supernatural feelings, because the concept exists in the space of language. But you cannot sell something for which you do not have the proper language. It is language which gives anything in existence. 

For example, big corporate groups sell independence day, friendship day, international mother language day, etc. As they have the language for those events, they can easily sell to you. For example, "desh amar, dayitto amar (my country, my responsibility)" slogan is sold by a famous telco company in Bangladesh. However, that thing is not their primary product, but they sell the sensation of those idea to make their product sensational. This is analogous to a company that not only sells the product but also the packaging.

And here comes the one important observation. The language of the July Uprisings in 2024 is not yet developed for corporates. That’s why most of the local corporations could not sell the 5th of August this year (2025). Without the required language, you cannot sell.

That's why, just after a year, you will not see any visible Facebook posts in the pages of local big corporations. I personally checked several, including some pages related to the Akij group. Even though they have influence in the current government, and the government was formed as a consequence of the July uprising, pages related to that company didn't post anything on the 5th of August this year (until 8:48 PM, 5th of August). 

However, many of the pages I observed posted about the Milestone School tragedy, as the accident truly happened and could be mourned using the language they already possess. In contrast, far more people died in the uprising. But without the proper language, it's unclear whether it should be seen as a mourning event or an entertaining one. That’s why local corporations couldn’t market or sell anything based on that idea.

My words may seem a bit incoherent. Maybe the idea is yet to be discovered broadly. Yes, I've also had the limit of my language. The limits of my language mean the limits of my world [1]. That's it for now. I'll have to think about it in more detail later.
